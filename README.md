# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!):https://pathfindingalgorithm.web.app/

## Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

**A* Search** (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm
